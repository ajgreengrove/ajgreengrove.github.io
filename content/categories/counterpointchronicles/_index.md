'Counterpoint Chronicles: Game Composing &amp; Theory Talk'
is the title of my ongoing series of twitch streams, in which:

1.  we 'mine' my game guitar covers for [Decrypting Game Music Theory Gems]({{< relref "decryptinggamemusictheorygems" >}}) &amp;
2.  we compose using that knowledge; thus [The Alchemy of Game Music Themes]({{< relref "thealchemyofgamemusicthemes" >}}).
