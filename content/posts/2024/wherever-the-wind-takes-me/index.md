Welcome dungeon crawling the nylon guitar!
Don't let the pastoral, Arcadian art
by Konsta Airisto
fool you -
here be music theory dragons.
Special mention to galant _partimento_ / _scale-degree schemata_
by R. Gjerdingen, G. Sanguinetti
&amp; other wizard legends.

(Note to reader: these are my earlier blogposts heavy in music theory
and meandering in thought.
I'll slowly revisit and backlink posts to clarify things.)

Even if the ignition to embark on this journey came from the dungeon synth genre,
I stole some good game soundtrack treasure along the way.
Going back to the galant school of casting,
I must mention two grand spell tomes for any serious scholar
of early / classical music on-the-spot composers:

-   R. Gjerdingen's "Music in the Galant Style" and
-   G. Sanguinetti's "Art of Partimento"

To peek into the 'audio dungeon explorations' of this album,
before shopping it in the Bandcamp market (for name your coins):

<div class="org-bandcamp-album"> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 472px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=2ebd35/album=3014684465/tracklist=true/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://ajgreengrove.bandcamp.com/album/ wherever-the-wind-takes-me"> "Wherever The Wind Takes Me" by A J Greengrove</a></iframe>

My mission is to create a spell "zibaldone" for game soundtrack composers.
Think: ancient type of magic book, a forgotten form of magic.
Truth is, the concept behind galant school of magic isn't specific to that style.
Schemata, or predefined scripts (V. Byros) or "framework notes" as I like to call them:
they apply to many kinds of music.

One day I will return with the Caduceus of Evorg from the final dungeon!

As I write of the 19 dungeon explorations,
you can find an automagically filling list
with short summaries in:
[Wherever The Wind Takes Me]({{< relref "whereverthewindtakesme" >}})

The recording was captured with following sorcery:

-   LilyPond to etch the motifs
-   Csound to shape the mixed elements
-   Ecasound to record the tune of the guitar

I also published a YouTube playlist of the album recording sessions:

I also compiled them into a single YouTube video:
