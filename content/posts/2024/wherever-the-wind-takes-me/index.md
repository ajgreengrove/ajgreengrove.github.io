"This 'dungeon nylon guitar' album ranges from early music pastiches
to soundtrack-like music, or fantasias if you will. A great way
to start this 'dungeon crawl' of game soundtracks."

I had this idea of "dungeon nylon guitar",
reflecting the "dungeon synth" genre.
I wasn't thinking of dungeon crawlers much:
retrospectively I was overly music theoretical,
inspired by Robert Gjerdingen's
Music in the Galant Style and such.
But speaking of game soundtrack quality,
even if there would be many pieces that would pass
in certain game situations,
I'd say "Fireflies Circling in the Rain" and
"Crystalline Chaotic Caves" are the examples
to explore further in my next game-music-specific
(is that even a word?) custom albums.

Overall, this album is a result of 19 on-the-spot compositions,
some of the pieces utilizing early music techniques
and some just motivic development in a more general sense.
Thus the overall sound ranges from early music pastiches
to soundtrack-like music, or fantasias if you will.
Letâ€™s see where the wind takes me next.
I crafted this album
by engraving the musical motifs in LilyPond
and producing the music with Csound.
More LilyPond-Csound madness to come.

I write blog posts for each piece separately.

I also published a YouTube playlist of the album recording sessions:

I also compiled them into a single YouTube video:
