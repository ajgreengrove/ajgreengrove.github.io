Is it the piece that started it all?
I can't remember how many pieces I had improvised this far,
but obviously this one is shot with my worse, i.e. 1st webcam.

Some music theory notes to myself and others:
in retrospect,
I hear the piece as modal in nature
specifically because of the accidentals in certain harmonies.
I might refer to some of the sequences later, so here they are:
a 2-up-3-down sequence closes the first half of the piece;
a descending-fifths sequence "masked" with
a smooth descending bass line in the latter half;
and also, I seem to have played cascading romanescas
(falling bass variants) in the latter half.
