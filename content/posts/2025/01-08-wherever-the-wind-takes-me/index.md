Wherever The Wind Takes Me:
arpeggiation of a single motive,
resulting in a deceptively simple prelude.

{{< figure src="/2025/01-08-WhereverTheWindTakesMe-feature.png" alt="The piece's motif in musical notation." caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 1: </span>\"Wherever The Wind Takes Me\" Motif" >}}

I came up with this piece after getting fed up
with the nigh impossible choral-style anti-guitarisms of
[Angels Carried me Away]]
in this same album.
To those familiar with early music improvisation concepts,
here I list the scale-degree schemata (or partimento concepts)
that I think might be useful for future improvisations.

To preview the track (then grab the album for "name your price" in Bandcamp):

In the 0:14 mark begins a "moti del basso" of a 2-up-3-down sequence,
which ends at 0:23 mark. Moti del basso is a partimento term,
literally "movement of the bass", basically sequences.
The modal addition that gives the harmony a dorian sound steals the show:
I wouldn't call it a conventional 2-up-3-down sequence;
or perhaps it speaks of the chameleon nature of the bass movement.
The 0:28 mark begins a large-scale fonte,
where each step lasts for four bass steps.
The fonte ends on the 0:41 mark.
Although I wouldn't read this as a proper Fonte Prinner,
the harmonies still cycle through a descending-fifths sequence.
The 0:41 mark begins a romanesca with the falling bassline,
but continues practically through the entire scale.
In the 1:00 mark occurs a converging cadence.

Here's the recording session video of the piece:
