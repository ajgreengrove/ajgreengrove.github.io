Fireflies Circling in the Rain:
The flourishing motif changes along with the underlying modes or scales.

{{< figure src="/2025/FirefliesCirclingInTheRain-feature.png" alt="The piece's motif in musical notation." caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 1: </span>\"Fireflies Circling in the Rain\" Motif" >}}

On this one I don’t have too much to say:
but, since this piece doesn’t rely on early music concepts per se,
I will use modern names for the modes or scales
that the motive cycles through:
first aeolian, followed by phrygian;
then dorian, and finally locrian.
