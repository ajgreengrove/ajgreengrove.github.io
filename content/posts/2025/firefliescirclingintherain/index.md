Fireflies Circling in the Rain:
The flourishing motif changes along with the underlying modes or scales.

(Note to reader: these are my earlier blogposts heavy in music theory and meandering in thought. I'll slowly revisit and backlink posts to clarify things.)

As atmospheric as the improvisation may have turned out,
theory-wise I don’t have too much to say on this one.
But since this piece doesn’t rely on early music concepts per se,
I will use modern names for the modes or scales
that the motive cycles through:
first aeolian, followed by phrygian;
then dorian, and finally locrian.
