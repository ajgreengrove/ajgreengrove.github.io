Twilight in the Marshlands:
This motif, I feel is rather soundtrack-like, serious and heavy.

{{< figure src="/2025/TwilightInTheMarshlands-feature.png" alt="The piece's motif in musical notation." caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 1: </span>\"Twilight in the Marshlands\" Motif" >}}

The opening harmony could be explained in many ways,
but for me i-bvi6-i suffices.
I just wondered whether Chopinâ€™s e minor prelude
utilizes similar devices:
melodic gestures accompanied with descending lines,
either in the bass or the middle voices,
some chromatic, some diatonic.
Perhaps Michael Koch (En blanc et noir YouTube channel)
could better explain some romantic schemata or compositional devices.

To preview the track (then grab the album for "name your price" in Bandcamp):

Anyway, the 1:25 mark
plays with the ambivalence of the augmented triad,
resolving perhaps unusually into the minor triad.
For the future,
I would be interested in exploring Carlo Gesualdo -style harmonies
in the format of this piece;
or neapolitan school of renaissance madrigal composers in general.

Here's the recording session video of the piece:
