Waltz with Me Moose Giants:
a chameleon motive, very useful for weaving counterpoint.

(Note to reader: these are my earlier blogposts heavy in music theory and meandering in thought. I'll slowly revisit and backlink posts to clarify things.)

Where’s all the 3/4 pieces in the music of our time?
Thematically this piece is an obvious dungeon synth parody.
Let's list some schemata for future improvisations.
in the 0:06 mark
we have a 7-6 suspension chain.
The bass follows a prinner,
and the melody could easily be replaced to follow one too.

To peek into this 'audio dungeon exploration'
before shopping it in the Bandcamp market (for name your coins):
<div class="org-bandcamp-track"> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album= 3014684465/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=2ebd35/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=4025779485/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://ajgreengrove.bandcamp.com/album/ wherever-the-wind-takes-me"> "Wherever The Wind Takes Me" by A J Greengrove</a></iframe>

The 0:18 mark lingers on a predominant harmony,
but doesn’t quite fit a stereotypical indugio.
I’ll still tag this piece with “indugio” for later comparisons.
The 0:35 mark begins a descending-fifths sequence,
however, in the first step the bass start from the inversion,
whereas in the continuation it starts from the root
of the underlying harmony.

The 0:42 mark chains another descending-fifths sequence,
this time with proper fifth leaps in the bass,
and the harmonic rhythm has doubled.
The 1:02 mark doesn’t quite initiate a fonte:
it should be read as a descending-fifths sequence
with inversions to my ear.

Here's the recording session video of the piece:
