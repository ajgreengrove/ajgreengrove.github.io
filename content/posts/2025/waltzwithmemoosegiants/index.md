Waltz with Me Moose Giants:
a chameleon motive, very useful for weaving counterpoint.

Where’s all the 3/4 pieces in the music of our time?
Thematically this piece is an obvious dungeon synth parody.

To preview the track (then grab the album for "name your price" in Bandcamp):

I’ll now list select schemata for future improvisations:
in the 0:06 mark
we have a 7-6 suspension chain.
The bass follows a prinner,
and the melody could easily be replaced to follow one too.
The 0:18 mark lingers on a predominant harmony,
but doesn’t quite fit a stereotypical indugio.
I’ll still tag this piece with “indugio” for later comparisons.
The 0:35 mark begins a descending-fifths sequence,
however, in the first step the bass start from the inversion,
whereas in the continuation it starts from the root
of the underlying harmony.
The 0:42 mark chains another descending-fifths sequence,
this time with proper fifth leaps in the bass,
and the harmonic rhythm has doubled.
The 1:02 mark doesn’t quite initiate a fonte:
it should be read as a descending-fifths sequence
with inversions to my ear.

Here's the recording session video of the piece:
