Revelations in Ancient Tombs:
what happens when you apply “chroma”,
Gesualdo-style, on a romanesca?

{{< figure src="/2025/RevelationsInAncientTombs-feature.png" alt="The piece's motif in musical notation." caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 1: </span>\"Revelations in Ancient Tombs\" Motif" >}}

To be fair, I should be talking more broadly of
the Neapolitan school of composers, not Carlo Gesualdo alone.
But we’re talking a niche within a niche within a... you get the point.
However, this is a romanesca, with “chroma” applied to it:
Elam Rotem describes chroma in his Early Music Sources YouTube video,
and the topic is Carlo Gesualdo (Rotem, 2021).
Also to clarify, this improvisation is less early music stylistic,
and applies more modern musical language;
it is not a Gesualdo-style pastiche at all.
However, improvisationally, the piece is very straightforward:
it explores quasi-arpeggiating the underlying framework notes.

To preview the track (then grab the album for "name your price" in Bandcamp):

For the future, I would love to come back regarding
more experiments with the renaissance concepts of chroma
and musica ficta, applied in unconventional places.
I will have more to add here later.
