False Relations in an English Town:
"Dalza’s basse danse meets the english cadence".

{{< figure src="/2025/FalseRelationsInAnEnglishTown-feature.png" alt="The piece's motif in musical notation." caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 1: </span>\"False Relations in an English Town\" Motif" >}}

As far as I remember,
in this improvisation I ripped off one of
Joan Ambrosio Dalza’s basse danses or pivas.
However, the main gist was to test out a final cadence with false relation;
also known as “english cadence” in renaissance music.

To preview the track (then go grab the album for "name your price in Bandcamp!):

It might make sense in the future to relate this improvisation
with the style of renaissance lute composers such as Luys Milan,
but right now I will leave this post deliberately short.
A few points for the future:

-   techniques by other renaissance composers
    to improvise on top of a drone or single-note bass,
-   Luys Milan and other composers
    utilizing guitar-friendly imitations between bass and upper voices,
-   english cadences by english composers,
    Thomas Tallis comes to mind,
-   and finally, other false relations:
    late renaissance or early baroque France comes to mind.
