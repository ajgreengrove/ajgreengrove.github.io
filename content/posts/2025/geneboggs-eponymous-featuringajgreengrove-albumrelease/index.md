"Eponymous:" an almost unlikely combination of electronica
and mellow guitars.

As I tend to do with albums,
I (re-)compiled a youtube playlist of the song audios:

Minimal structures and textures meet the guitar
that phrases longer melodic arcs.
Delicate synths and recorded instruments meet plucked nylon strings.
Hope you enjoy. Gene Boggs is Epistemologist-at-large.
The featuring artist A J Greengrove is a musician
in the early music sense:
one who plays, improvises, composes
both on-the-spot
and with longer processes.
