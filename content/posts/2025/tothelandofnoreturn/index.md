To the Land of No Return:
A postlude that opens with a minor romanesca
and reflects on the opening track.

The piece opens with a minor romanesca, and perhaps one anticipates a minor prinner in the 0:9 mark.

To preview the track (then go grab the album for "name your price" in Bandcamp!):

However, what could also be thought of is the descending upper tetrachord.
Heard this way, in that same 0:9 mark,
we can hear the descending lower tetrachord.
What is nice is the analogy between the VI chord in the 0:7 mark
and the bII chord in the 0:14 mark,
and how the latter transmutes into the half-diminished harmony.
The aforementioned bII or phrygian chord leaves its mark:
in 0:24 the arpeggio motif is heard in bII (or its inversion,
if that’s relevant).
The 0:28 mark doesn’t exactly have
a chromatically descending tetrachord schema,
since it occurs in the middle voice instead of the bass.
Interestingly, even if the bass lingers on scale degree 5,
I can’t hear a ponte in it:
rather, I hear roaming or seeking quality in the harmonies.
In the 1:07 mark, the bII or phrygian occurs once more,
affecting the descending lower tetrachord.
