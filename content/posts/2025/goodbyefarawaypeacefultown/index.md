Goodbye Faraway Peaceful Town:
instead of a shepherd in Arcadia,
I associate romanesca with town themes (damn gamer).

{{< figure src="/2025/GoodbyeFarawayPeacefulTown-feature.png" alt="The piece's motif in musical notation." caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 1: </span>\"Goodbye Faraway Peaceful Town\" Motif" >}}

The first half is stepwise romanesca,
the latter half if in many repetitions the same as in Pachelbelâ€™s canon.
Later in the piece these latter halves tend
to ride the descending-fifths sequence rollercoaster.

To preview the track (then grab the album for "name your price" in Bandcamp):

In the 0:30 mark (see player below for playback)
the texture starts to sound quite galant.
However, I do not understand what the hell
is the purpose of the major 7th sonority
in the 01:00 mark and the subsequent 7th chords?
It does saturate and sweeten things a bit,
but incongruently so.
Well, perhaps the cool ending minor-major7th sonority
permits the use of such oversaturated harmonies.

Here's the recording session video of the piece:
