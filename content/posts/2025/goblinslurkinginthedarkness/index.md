Goblins Lurking in the Darkness:
the most blatant dungeon synth parody of this album.

{{< figure src="/2025/GoblinsLurkingInTheDarkness-feature.png" alt="The piece's motif in musical notation." caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 1: </span>\"Goblins Lurking in the Darkness\" Motif" >}}

This improvisation seems to explore
what other voices can do
while one voice performs 1-7; 7-1 "pendulum" movement.

To preview the track (then go grab the album for "name your price" in Bandcamp!):

The piece opens with the static bass utilizing a pedal point schema.
The 0:4 mark (see player below for playback)
sees a 4-3 movement in the upper voice against the 7-1.
The 0:6 mark sees a 6-5 movement similarly.
The 0:9 mark is more embellished,
but can be reductively said to be a 4-3 movement.
In the 0:16 mark, the three voices utilize a simple faux bourdon -technique.
Perhaps more a question to the reader rather than a statement,
can the 0:25 mark be read as an indugio,
that is a suspenseful pedal point schema on scale degree 4?
In the 0:43 mark we hear a ponte,
that is a pedal point schema on scale degree 5.
