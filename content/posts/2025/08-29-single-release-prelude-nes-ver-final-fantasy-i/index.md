Let's Play Final Fantasy I - with Guitar!
"Prelude" (NES Version specifically) and "Game Over" for starters.
Konsta Airisto's mage art captures nicely the
hidden music theory wizardries in the game's soundtrack.
I now explain the journey that awaits us (EP and Album to come).

-   I'll write a short music theory blogpost for each of the game soundtracks.
-   Then I use that knowledge to compose custom game music,
    and learn something new about enhancing games with music;
-   filling the game composer's "zibaldone" tome;
    a quest I previously declared in the post
    [Album Unveiled: "Wherever The Wind Takes Me"]({{< relref "wherever-the-wind-takes-me" >}}).

The choice of Final Fantasy I vs. early music theory is not a coincidence. ; )

As usual, to peek into the 'audio dungeon explorations' of this album:
you can access the streams with "smart Link"
(apple music requires a search):

And as before, as I write of these 19(+?) dungeon explorations,
you can find the automagically filling list with short summaries in:
[Final Fantasy I]({{< relref "finalfantasyi" >}}).
In fact, that category page gets updated with any FF1 -related blogposts.

Why Final Fantasy I? Just like V,
it perfectly captures the idea of a magical land,
with the damsel in distress you save from the dragon,
except this time he's an evil knight named Garland.
Theres' other reasons:

-   The fact that it took inspiration from Dragon Quest,
    which we can possibly discuss later
-   We have especially the
    NES (1987), PS1 (2002) and Pixel Remaster (2021) versions,
    which provide a nice comparison point for advances in soundtrack styles,
-   The composer being Nobuo Uematsu,
    who is rightfully called a grandfather of video game composing

This recording is captured with Csound / Ecasound command line magic
to capture the guitar's tunes and mix the music.


## Updates {#updates}

Addendum story: I had already recorded almost all of Final Fantasy I,
but then my laptop broke;
stupid me did not have a backup system robust enough.
Now I'm a happy user of B2 Backblaze (just 1 CLI command and backup begins!)
but I thought screw it, let's follow the waterfall release model to get started already
(single, then EP, then the actual damn full album).
