It's time to start getting into game soundtracks:
here's the first release on that path,
"Prelude NES Ver. Final Fantasy I".
In addition to the prelude it features "Game Over"
from the original soundtrack.
To be clear, these are guitar covers.

Since this is a guitar cover single it's not in Bandcamp,
so I'll drop the "smart link" where you can find
Spotify and other streaming services (save for
apple music, but you'll find it there by searching for me):

-   So the big idea is to write a short music theory blogpost
    for each of the tracks; then use that to compose custom
    video game music.
-   Naturally, I'll post guitar recording videos soon (tomorrow?)

So stay tuned!
