It's Time to Set The Sails:
I ripped of an unknown composer’s “Forest Theme” from Terra Incognita,
a Net Yaroze demo game.

{{< figure src="/2025/ItsTimeToSetTheSails-feature.png" alt="The piece's motif in musical notation." caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 1: </span>\"It's Time to Set The Sails\" Motif" >}}

There isn’t really info on the composer
of the soundtrack in Terra Incognita the Net Yaroze demo:
(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">TeamFatal, 1997</a>).
The first half is a descending tetrachord bassline.
This can be found as a ground bass
to be improvised upon in numerous chaconnes and passacaglias.

To preview the track (then go grab the album for "name your price" in Bandcamp!):
<div class="org-bandcamp-track"> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album= 3014684465/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=2ebd35/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1925270107/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://ajgreengrove.bandcamp.com/album/ wherever-the-wind-takes-me"> "Wherever The Wind Takes Me" by A J Greengrove</a></iframe>

More than the descending tetrachord, I wanted to test
specifically the 2-up-3-down moti del basso (sequence)
in the chorus or B-part or latter part of the song;
it is heard in the 0:32 mark.
However, in the second step of the pattern,
the vi scale-degree breaks the sequence (should be IV).
I would call the sequence a bit of a chameleon:
it could easily be replaced by a descending-fifths sequence,
but it is “softer” in its movement, or perceived movement.
In the 0:47 mark, that is the latter repetition of the B-section,
I unfold it as a descending-fifths sequence.
If I may contrast the word “soft” with the word “dynamical”,
this time the bass acts in a more “dynamical” manner.
Compare these to the 2-up-3-down sequence heard in
[Wherever The Wind Takes Me]({{< relref "01-08-wherever-the-wind-takes-me" >}}) of in this same album,
however, in that instance dorian modal harmony draws attention;
I don’t find it a typical example of the bass movement.
My theory is the sequence works in adventurous sea themes,
prove me wrong. As 1-7-6-3 constitues the galant romanesca,
I wonder what this 6-7-5-1 (in minor key) constitutes.
I’ll accumulate evidence from the seas
and throw it out in the open later on.
It’s time to set the sails.
