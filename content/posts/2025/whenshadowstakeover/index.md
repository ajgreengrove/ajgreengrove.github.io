When Shadows Take Over:
the final
"let’s explore dark, minor modal mixture"
of this album.

I already listed the other pieces exploring similar concepts,
this one included, in
[Strong Currents in the Unknown Waters]({{< relref "strongcurrentsintheunknownwaters" >}}).
Now I will list some peculiarities for this piece.

To preview the track (then go grab the album for "name your price" in Bandcamp!):

The 0:33 mark flirts with a minor7th harmony,
which will permeate the rest of this improvisation.
By opening the seventh sonorities,
I like to think of an analogy of applying more saturation
to the harmonic palette.
Referring to the many pieces of this album
"exploring dark, minor modal mixture":
interestingly,
the minor seventh sweetens the bvi:m7 in the 00:38 mark somewhat.
The subsequent passages remind me of Nobuo Uematsu’s middle period style,
something like Final Fantasy VI or VII soundtracks,
to be honest.
FinallyFantasylly,
I didn’t anticipate the 13 &amp; +9 chords in the 1:02 mark?
In the 1:33 mark an arpeggiated dominant
introduces an allusion to augmented harmony,
which is unheard of elsewhere in this piece;
however, since we’re in the middle of repeating the opening material,
this does provide some variance.
The 1:50 mark introduces a half-diminished harmony:
however, in my thinking,
it actually acts as a
"dominant for the natural phrygian closure",
or in other words the final harmony in the 1:54 mark.

Here's the recording session video of the piece:
