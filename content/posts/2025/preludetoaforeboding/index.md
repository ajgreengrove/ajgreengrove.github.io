Prelude to a Foreboding:
The static use of the arpeggio motive creates tension;
"trailer music" vibes.

{{< figure src="/2025/PreludeToAForeboding-feature.png" alt="The piece's motif in musical notation." caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 1: </span>\"Prelude to a Foreboding\" Motif" >}}

This could be called an etude or exercise for creating tension
with slow voice leading.
The harmonies could perhaps be traced to Opeth or Bossa Nova.
In other words, the tropes are more reminiscent
of more modern music than I usually focus on in this blog.
I might be able to come back and dissect this better
after writing on Gabriel Faure’s use of Rule of The Octave.
If you got curious, I recommend an article named
Reimagining Fauré’s Harmony (Rabinovitch, 2023).
