In this Not-How-To anti-tutorial,
I compose game music (map theme) inspired by the "Wrong-Note" prelude,
as I wrote &amp; videoed in [The "Wrong-Note" Prelude of Final Fantasy I (1987 NES)]({{< relref "08-30-prelude-nes-ver-final-fantasy-i" >}}).
After the arpeggios there's an ascending-fifths (aka "mountain")
sequence and a classic ii-V-(I reinterpreted as III) turnaround.
I recommend skipping with the use of timestamps,
unless the composing process itself interests you or maybe viewing in the background.

This is more of a prototype, but it is the first installment
of a live-composition series called [The Alchemy of Game Music Themes]({{< relref "thealchemyofgamemusicthemes" >}}).

Originally the idea was to just to simply
use the music theory concepts of the Final Fantasy Prelude.
But the truth is, I composed the first half on a whim,
and while it's not musically all that complex,
it would be a hindrance to analyze everything to full extent here.
As an example of getting bogged down is the very first harmony:
as a Bbmaj7/F, it shares both qualities of starting with VI
but also starting on a III because of the bass.
Discussing these kinds of details further shall await later times.

0:00:00 Revenge of the Nyancat -climax teaser (episode starts in 25:16)<br />
0:00:02 Preview (notice the fakebit sounds, almost like chiptune)<br />
0:00:12 Setting up &amp; "explaining" (chaotically) the premise the livestream<br />
0:01:00 Shovel Knight<br />
0:01:20 Bass line (+ chaotic talking)<br />
0:02:08 Playing the ascending-fifths ("mountain") sequence with the guitar<br />
0:02:46 So Milton Babitt once mentioned Schoenberg not laying out an overall plan for a composition: and because of that, never finishing it.<br />
0:04:29 Playing the beginning arpeggios tentatively with the guitar<br />
0:04:45  @StevenMelin   once explained: in games, the sounds fill the middle frequencies, so us composers fill the highs and lows<br />
0:05:07 Sketching the ascending-fifths ("mountain") sequence but didn't know where it would harmonically land us<br />
0:05:36 Before "palm mute", Fernando Sor used "etouffez": think palm mute with the left hand(!). Sounds soft &amp; cool!<br />
0:07:16 Too detailed to fully cover here, but in short: the question of the sequence's step with the semitone is placed in the ascending-fifths ("mountain") sequence<br />
0:08:18 Testing the plagal IVb3 but didn't work<br />
0:08:45 Sketching the final turnaround<br />
0:09:54 Initial mention of counterpoint: I finished the more rich texture after the livestreams that had already dragged on quite a while<br />
0:11:14 The second live stream begins. Trying to explain things more clearly, didn't really.<br />
0:12:38 Trying to compose a theme that works in menu and map: actually, worked better in game "Opaloid Kingdom"<br />
0:16:00 Sketching the end of the game audio loop<br />
0:17:18 This is when tiredness starts to kick in, and chaos emerges.<br />
0:17:57 Elision: the B part elides into the C part without a clear boundary (not demonstrated clearly here).<br />
0:20:31 Sketching the percussive aspects of this piece<br />
0:21:50  @StevenMelin   once explained: when game music matches the "rhythms": actions &amp; movements etc of the game, that's good<br />
0:22:17 Shoving "figueta" with the guitar: instead of alternate picking. Better for weaving improvised counterpoint.<br />
0:24:33 Beverage Break begins<br />
0:25:16 Revenge of the Nyancat -episode begins<br />
0:25:58 Revenge of the Nyancat -episode climax<br />
0:27:39 I understood to make it map theme, not menu<br />
0:29:44 The guitar is not... (? Guess the mystery!) -episode<br />
0:32:27 Using Csound's flanger opcode for the guitar. Nice.<br />
0:34:01 I realized this piece works better in Opaloid Kingdom than Shovel Knight<br />

After an insane amount of (re-)editing,
I'll just leave this as is:
as I said above, there's just too much to cover.
I'll break down the stuff into bite-sized pieces
and cover all of them eventually,
re-editing this post as I go.
