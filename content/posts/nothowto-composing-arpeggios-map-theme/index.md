In this Not-How-To anti-tutorial,
I compose game music (map theme) inspired by the "Wrong-Note" prelude,
as I wrote &amp; videoed in [The "Wrong-Note" Prelude of Final Fantasy I (1987 NES)]({{< relref "08-30-prelude-nes-ver-final-fantasy-i" >}}).
After the arpeggios there's an ascending-fifths (aka "mountain")
sequence and a classic ii-V-(I reinterpreted as III) turnaround.
I recommend skipping with the use of timestamps,
unless the composing process itself interests you or maybe viewing in the background.

Originally the idea was to just to simply
use the music theory concepts of the Final Fantasy Prelude.
But the truth is, I composed the first half on a whim,
and while it's not musically all that complex,
it would be a hindrance to analyze everything to full extent here.
As an example of getting bogged down is the very first harmony:
as a Bbmaj7/F, it shares both qualities of starting with VI
but also starting on a III because of the bass.
Discussing these kinds of details further shall await later times.

After an insane amount of (re-)editing,
I'll just leave this as is:
as I said above, there's just too much to cover.
I'll break down the stuff into bite-sized pieces
and cover all of them eventually,
re-editing this post as I go.
