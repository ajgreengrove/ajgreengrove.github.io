A J Greengrove is a musician in the early music sense:
one who plays, improvises and composes both on-the-spot
and with longer processes.
More experiments with early music concepts to come.
I play a nylon-stringed Godin guitar,
engrave scores in LilyPond,
and compose utilizing
the powerful csound audio domain-specific programming language.
