I play game guitar covers to discuss them and early music theory.
I then compose soundtracks focusing on narrative storytelling.

For all my creations under the "A J Greengrove" moniker
from latest to earliest,
see [Works]({{< relref "works" >}}).

I play a nylon-stringed Godin guitar,
engrave scores in LilyPond,
and compose utilizing
the powerful csound audio domain-specific programming language;
then record using ecasound.
Thing is: this enables an almost complete plaintext workflow.

If you have more questions, don't hesitate to [Contact]({{< relref "contact" >}}) me!
