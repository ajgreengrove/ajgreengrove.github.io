-   I play game guitar covers,
    then decrypt music theory
    to compose game music soundtracks.
-   Perhaps find my [Works]({{< relref "works" >}}) (latest to earliest)
-   I play a nylon-stringed Godin guitar;
    engrave scores by coding them in(to) LilyPond;
    program Csound synths for 'summoning' (I try make them as alive as possible);
-   I use ecasound, a multitrack recorder to mix my music in the command line.
-   A most beautiful thing: all this enables an almost complete **plaintext workflow.**

If you have commissions or questions perhaps, don't hesitate to [Contact]({{< relref "contact" >}}) me!
